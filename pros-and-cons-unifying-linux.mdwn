### Unifying Distributions (political/technical)

One interesting outcome of the development around systemd is that
many distributions adopt it. If you dislike systemd (for whatever reason)
this may be a disadvantage. However, having the same 
**init system** on all Unices would make life much easier
for sysadmins and authors of configuration management 
systems (like [cdist](http://www.nico.schottelius.org/software/cdist/)).
