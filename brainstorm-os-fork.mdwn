### The radical move #2: Fork your OS

If you want to stick with your OS, but don't like to be forced
to use systemd, but the OS maintainers decided to go or stay with
systemd, a radical, but maybe problem solving move may be to fork
your OS.

This idea has been spoken out in form of a
[Debian Fork](http://debianfork.org/) so far.
