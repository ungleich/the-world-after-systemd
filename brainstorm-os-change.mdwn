### The radical move #1: Change your OS

When you read reactions of people who are unhappy about
systemd, you will find one solution to the problem very often:
To change the OS to something that is not dependent or tightly
coupled to systemd.

Currently this could mean switching to a BSD based OS,
Gentoo, Slackware, or some other Linux distribution
without Systemd (or at least a tightly-coupled Systemd)
(list of Linux distros meeting this requirement should
be added here).
