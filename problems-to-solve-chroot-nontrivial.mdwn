### Starting Services in chroots (technical)

When you run an init system like systemd that requires a helper
program to start services (**systemctl**), it is not easily 
possible to start services in a chroot, because the chrooted
systemctl cannot connect to the outer systemd.

Using init scripts or a different type of cli that does not require
another daemon to run (like sysvinit does with the shell scripts
below /etc/{rc.d,init.d}), solves this problem.

There is a [detailled description of the problem at 0pointer.de](http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/changing-roots.html).

So in short, running services in a chrooted environment became
harder with systemd.
