### Why do some people like to use systemd?

To be honest, there are not only people who dislike systemd.
So for some reason, people were inspired to switch and see
using systemd as an advantage.

So in case it becomes clear, what people aspire, there is a chance
to rebuild those components of systemd in a modular, Unix way
and to remove or stay without systemd.
