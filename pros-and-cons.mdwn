## Pros and Cons

Let's have a look what systemd actually makes better and what
are the problems that are new due to having systemd.

Again, this is not a rant-or-blame page, but focussed on
analysis and to make the basis for future steps.

If you do not agree with something written here, please

### Unifying Distributions (political/technical)

One interesting outcome of the development around systemd is that
many distributions adopt it. If you dislike systemd (for whatever reason)
this may be a disadvantage. However, having the same 
**init system** on all Unices would make life much easier
for sysadmins and authors of configuration management 
systems (like [cdist](http://www.nico.schottelius.org/software/cdist/).


### Starting Services in chroots (technical)

When you run an init system like systemd that requires a helper
program to start services (**systemctl**), it is not easily 
possible to start services in a chroot, because the chrooted
systemctl cannot connect to the outer systemd.

Using init scripts or a different type of cli that does not require
another daemon to run (like sysvinit does with the shell scripts
below /etc/{rc.d,init.d}), solves this problem.

So in short, running services in a chrooted environment became
harder with systemd.
