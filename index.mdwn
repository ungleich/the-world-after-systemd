Welcome to a world after 
[systemd](http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/). 
After systemd?

[[!inline pages="why-after" raw=yes]]
[[!inline pages="this-site" raw=yes]]

## Problems to solve
[[!inline pages="problems-to-solve-linux-only" raw=yes]]

We anticipate that systemd is currently in fashion, however many of
us have seen software rising and falling, especially if it was 
ill designed (sendmail anyone?).

In that sense we are planning for the time when distros and users
are beginning to **migrate away from systemd**.

## What this site is about

We are beginning to write down our concerns about systemd,
what are the good and bad things it brings and how to move
on.

We focus on being productive for the next generation of people using
Linux and other Unices (yes, they exist and yes, they are important, too!).

## What is this site not about

It is not a place for ranting. 
If you want to blame/rant, please look for another site.
