## I want to contribute!

That's great! There are various possibilities to help:

### Talk about us

Mention **#theworldaftersystemd** on Twitter, 
talk about our movement on IRC, help others to understand 
why the current implementation of systemd is not a good idea.

Use your favorite chat/publish/mention tool to do so and 
include us. We are reachable on IRC (see below), via
mail **theworldaftersystemd --at-- ungleich.ch** or
Twitter [@ungleich](https://twitter.com/ungleich)
